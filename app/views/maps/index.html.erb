	    <h3>How to Play on Server</h3>
        <p>
           If you like this map and you want to play on a server that has almost no administration on it other then to use it to test out this site you can join the server at any time. Just use this url to join <strong>mcadmin.r3dux.net</strong>. If that did not work for you here is the IP address of the server <strong>198.61.196.120</strong>.

        <h3>Last Updated</h3>
        <p>
            Right now this map is old very old really this map is from the day I started working on this thing. Really it has been a lot of fun but I have not updated yet.

        <h3>Future Goals</h3>
        <p>
            The Goals of this is to make a sort of service where it lists out the minecraft servers that you can join. However in order to do that you have to create a lot data and well I don't exactly have a lot of storage for that much information. Seeing how each small map takes up about a GIG worth of data I really don't have a solution.
